## Problem Title

AIDE: AI-Based Interview & Domain Evaluation Platform

## Problem Description

A web platform that simulates real-life interview panels for job applicants and promotions, especially for scientific and technical roles. It allows experts to ask relevant questions based on the candidate’s domain and resume. The system uses AI to evaluate both the quality of questions and the answers.

The platform provides scores for:

How relevant an expert's question is to the applicant’s profile

How well the candidate’s answer matches the question

The overall score helps in selecting the most suitable candidate. The experience is designed to feel like a real boardroom interview with ice-breaking, technical, and managerial questions.

Candidates and interviewers get a smooth, bias-free interview experience powered by smart AI.

## Idea

1.Smart Question Generator
Uses AI/NLP to generate domain-specific questions based on the candidate’s resume, job role, and experience level. Ensures each interview is tailored and relevant.

2.Live & Asynchronous Interview Modes
Supports both live panel interviews and pre-recorded (asynchronous) sessions. Candidates can record answers to questions at their convenience.

3.AI-Based Answer Evaluation
Evaluates candidate responses using AI for technical accuracy, clarity, relevance, and communication. Generates a subject knowledge score for unbiased ranking.

4.Virtual Boardroom Experience
Simulates a real-time interview environment with panel avatars, ice-breaker interactions, and follow-up questions — improving candidate confidence and realism.

5.Expert Dashboard & Analytics
Interviewers get a dashboard with question relevance score, candidate performance graphs, and final suitability score. Helps in fair, data-driven decision making.
